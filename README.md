## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This repository showcases two projects that demonstrate advanced programming techniques in C++ and multithreading. The first project, Multi-Threaded-Stack, utilizes multithreading processes to add items to a stack in a linear manner. By creating a mutex, the code is locked and unlocked to prevent overwriting when multiple threads add to the stack. The second project, Hashing Between Two Pipes, demonstrates the forking of a process and communication of hashing outputs between two pipes. This was developed during an Operating Systems lecture and showcases the use of pipes in inter-process communication. Both projects highlight the versatility and complexity of C++ programming and the use of advanced techniques in solving programming challenges.

## üíª Programming Styles and Techniques <a name = "#techniques"></a>
The combined repository encompasses advanced coding subjects and programming methods, showcasing the following skills:

Multithreading: The Multi-Threaded Stack project demonstrates the mastery of managing concurrent threads and synchronization using mutexes, ensuring thread safety and avoiding race conditions.

Inter-Process Communication: The Hashing Between Two Pipes project showcases the skillful implementation of inter-process communication using pipes, allowing the seamless exchange of data between parent and child processes.

C++ Programming: The Hashing Between Two Pipes project, written in C++, highlights the ability to leverage low-level programming languages and showcases the understanding of memory management and process control in an operating systems context.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
